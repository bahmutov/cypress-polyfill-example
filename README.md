> Check if the ES6 polyfill is correctly working

Read the blog post üìù [Test Polyfills](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/test-polyfills/)

ES6 method [Array.prototype.findLast](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findLast)

Using [core-js polyfill](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) from CDN, see [index.html](./index.html)

We are removing some of the ES6 Array methods from the `window.Array` object when visiting the page. If the page does not load a polyfill and does not apply it correctly, the application will throw an error.

```js
cy.visit('index.html', {
  onBeforeLoad(win) {
    delete win.Array.prototype.findLast
  },
})
cy.contains('button', 'Find').click()
cy.contains('output', '130')
```
